Here is a partial description of the raw CSV output file.

It contains all the raw timing information of everything that I thought
worth measuring. Actually, initially I did the summarization in a
spreadsheet, but it turned out that each and every spreadsheet slows
down to a crawl when you have in the order of a couple thousand records
and want to do aggregation over them.

Here's a quick breakdown of the fields, let me know if you need more
info:

timestamp - when this record was generated.(microseconds since epoch,
which is almost much start-of-run) eventClass, eventName - what has
happened

the data, extraName, extraData  fields depend on eventClass/eventName:

systemTime / systemTime - gives current Unix time in "data", so you can
convert timestamps to wallclock

macVideoXmit / generated - QR code has been put on-screen. data is the
QR code, extraName is "overhead", extraData is the the overhead (in
microseconds) incurred in generating and displaying the QR code, insofar
as this is measurable.

macVideoGrab / data - Good QR code detection. data is the QR code,
extraName is "overhead", extraData is the the overhead (in microseconds)
incurred in grabbing, detecting and decoding the QR code, insofar as
this is measurable. A second (or subsequent) detection of the same QR
code does not generate a new record.

macVideoGrab / baddata - Bad QR code detection, i.e. it is a QR code,
but not the one we were expecting.

macVideoGrab / nodata - No QR code detected.

{hardwareXmit, macVideoXmit} / {black, white} - no light/light emission
by the hardware and screen emitters

{hardwareGrab, macVideoGrab} / {black, white} - no light/light
detections by the hardware and camera detectors
