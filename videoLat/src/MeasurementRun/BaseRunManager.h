/// Implementations of this class should be able to handle both input and output, but
/// they may have to handle only one of those, based on how things are initialized in the NIB.
/// If the object should handle both (for example during a VideoRun) both inputCompanion
/// and outputCompanion refer to self.
/// If the object should handle only input or output (for example during a MixedRun)
/// the inputCompanion of the output object refers to the other object
/// and vice versa.
///
/// In addition, the class methods implement a repository for remembering all available
/// measurement types and their NIBs (initialized by the class initializers of the subclasses).
