/// A Subclass of BaseRunManager geared towards doing hardware-assisted video
/// measurements. It works together with an object implementing the low-level
/// HardwareLightProtocol to generate light/no light conditions and detect them.
///
/// This class works closely together with HardwareLightProtocol, and actually with
/// its only current implementation, LabJackDevice. Testing with other hardware and
/// allowing selection of input and output device has not been implemented.
///
/// When compared to the other run manager this class also implements the input and
/// selection view object functionality. Should be fixed at some point.
