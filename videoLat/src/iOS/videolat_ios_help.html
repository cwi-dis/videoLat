<h2>Getting Started</h2>

	<p>These are concise instructions, more complete information is available on
	the <a href="https://videoLat.org">videoLat.org website</a>.</p>

	<p>Before you can do real measurements you must obtain calibrations for
	your input and output devices. Try downloading calibrations from videolat.org
	first. If the calibrations you need are not available you must do them yourself.</p>

<h2>Camera Calibration using Remote Calibrated Screen</h2>

	<p>For this you need a second device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) with videoLat for which
	you already have calibrations. Both devices should be on the same Wi-Fi network.</p>

	<p>On this device select <em>New Calibration</em>, then
	<em>Reception Calibrate using Other Device</em>.
	Select the camera you want to calibrate. Point it so that you can see the screen of
	the other device.</p>

	<p>On the other, calibrated, device select <em>New Measurement</em>, 
	then <em>QR Code Transmission to Camera Helper</em>. A QR-code will be shown on the
	transmitting device. When this QR-code is picked up by the camera of the device to calibrate it will connect to the transmitting device
	over Wi-Fi. Check the status indicators on the top of the device screen.</p>

	<p>On the device to calibrate press <em>Run</em>, and after a few hundred measurements
	<em>Stop</em>. You will be
	shown the results of the measurement, on both devices.</p>

<h2>Screen Calibration using Remote Calibrated Camera</h2>

	<p>For this you need a second device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) with videoLat for which
	you already have calibrations. Both devices should be on the same Wi-Fi network.</p>

	<p>On the other, calibrated, device select <em>New Measurement</em>, 
	then <em>QR Code Reception</em>.

	<p>On this device select <em>New Calibration</em>, then
	<em>Transmission Calibrate using Other Device</em>.
    Point this camera of the calibrated device at the QR-code shown on the
	master device and calibrated device will connect to the master device
	over Wi-Fi. Check the status indicators on the top of the device screen.</p>

	<p>On the master device press <em>Run</em>, and after a few hundred measurements
	<em>Stop</em>. You will be
	shown the results of the measurement, on both devices.</p>
	
<h2>Video measurement</h2>

	<p>For a one-way measurement you need two devices with videoLat and the required
	calibrations. The master device must be on a network (Wi-Fi or Cellular) that is
	reachable by the helper device. The master device shows QR codes, which should be picked up by
    the camera of the system-under-test. The output screen of the system-under-test should be picked
    up by the helper videoLat camera. It will transmit the QR-codes detected back to the master
    videoLat over the network.</p>

	<p>On the secondary device do <em>New Measurement</em>,
	then <em>QR Code Camera Helper</em>. Make sure the camera of this helper
	device can see the screen of the system-under-test.</p>
	
	<p>On the master device do <em>New Measurement</em>, 
	then <em>QR Code Transmission to Camera Helper</em>. Make sure the screen of the master
	device is picked up by the camera of the system-under-test. 
	A QR-code will be shown on the
	master device and is picked up by the helper device, and it will connect to the master device
	over Wi-Fi. Check the status indicators on the top of the device screen.</p>

	<p>On the master device press <em>Run</em>, and after a few hundred measurements
	<em>Stop</em>. You will be
	shown the results of the measurement, on both devices.</p>

<h2>Roundtrip calibration and measurement</h2>

    <p>Note that roundtrip measurements are in general not very easy on an iPhone or iPad
    because you cannot position the camera and screen independently.</p>
    
    <p>Select <em>New Calibration</em>, then <em>QR Code Roundtrip Calibration</em>.
    Select the camera you want to use. Use a mirror
    (or 2 mirrors) to make sure that camera gets a good view of the whole screen.
    Press <em>Continue</em>. You will see QR-codes and the <em>Count:</em> field
    will go from 10 to 0. When you see the blue screen you press <em>Run</em>.
    After enough measurements (a few hundred) press <em>Stop</em>. You will be
    shown the results of the measurement.</p>
    
    <p>See the instruction video on the <a href="https://videoLat.org">videoLat.org website</a>
    for instructions on how to run a round-trip video delay measurement.</p>
    

<h2>Viewing measurements</h2>

	<p>Here you see the minimum, maximum and average of your measurement, plus
	information on where and how the measurement was done. You also see graphs
	with the individual measured delays and the distribution of those delays.</p>
	
	<p>Using the <em>Action</em> button you can print or email your measurement
	in various forms. You can also delete your measurement, and for calibrations
	you can upload them to videolat.org so other people can download it.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>VideoLat does transmit any data to cloud services, except when you upload
    a calibration measurement. The full privacy policy can be viewed at
