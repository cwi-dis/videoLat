/// Base class for objects that control a delay measurement run, i.e. a sequence of
/// many individual delay measurements and collects and stores the individual delays.
///
/// Implementations of this class should be able to handle both input and output, but
/// they may have to handle only one of those, based on how things are initialized in the NIB.
/// If the object should handle both (for example during a VideoRun) both @see inputCompanion
/// and @see outputCompanion refer to self.
/// If the object should handle only input or output (for example during a MixedRun)
/// the @see inputCompanion of the output object refers to the other object
/// and vice versa.
///
/// In addition, the class methods implement a repository for remembering all available
/// measurement types and their NIBs (initialized by the class initializers of the subclasses).
