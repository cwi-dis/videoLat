Here is a description of the three CSV export files.

The "description" file contains two columns, "key" and "value". This
file contains the metadata of the measurement run, such as measurement type
and devices used.

The "measurements" file continas the raw measurements. It has three columns:
- "at" is the time of the measurement, in microseconds, since some unspecified epoch.
- "data" is a string, representing the image (or sound) generated at that time
- "delay" is the delay in microseconds until the image/sound was detected again

The "distribution" file contains a frequency distribution of the measurements,
split over 100 bins.
It is for convenience only, it can be generated from the measurements file,
but in Numbers or Excel this can take an inordinate amount of time if you have
many data points. It has three columns:
- "lowerBound" is the lower bound of the bin
- "upperBound" is the upper bound of the bin (which is the lower bound of the next one)
- "binValue" is the fraction of the measurements that fall into this bin.
