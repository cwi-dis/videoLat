videoLat README
===============

VideoLat is a tool to help you analyse video delays, mainly aimed at
conferencing applications. Basically, it works by generating a barcode
on-screen and then measuring how long it takes until that same barcode is
detected by the camera. This method of measurement also takes into account
delays caused by camera, grabber hardware, video output card and the video
display.

VideoLat can take round-trip measurements, with the same system both
benerating and detecting the barcodes. A future release will also allow
asymetric measurements, using a videoLat-system on both ends.

If you have access to the internals of the system-under-test it is possible
to take measurements there as well, because videoLat encodes the current
timestamp in the barcode.

Download
========

Binary installers and source code can be downloaded via
<http://videolat.sourceforge.net>. Installation is optional: videoLat can
run in-place.

Usage
=====

Instructions on using videoLat are available in the built-in help page and
on <http://videolat.sourceforge.net>.

Build Instructions
==================

To build videoLat from source you need a Mac (10.6 has been tested).
You need two third party packages:

- zbar (version 0.10 tested) for barcode generation
- zint (version 2.3.2 tested) for barcode detection

These should be included in a videoLat source distribution in the thirdParty
subdirectory.

You also need a few more packages, install these through macports, all universal:

% sudo port install libiconv +universal
% sudo port install ImageMagick +universal
% sudo port install cmake +universal

(this list may be incomplete, please inform me if this is the case).

1. Build zbar with:
	% cd thirdParty/zbar-0.10-src
	% ./configure \
		--disable-dependency-tracking \
		--disable-video \
		--without-gtk \
		--without-qt \
		PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig \
		CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" \
		CXXFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" \
		LDFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64"
	% make
No need to install.

2. Build zint with:
	% cd thirdParty/zint-2.3.2
	% export PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH
	% cd build
	% export CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="i386;x86_64"
	% cmake ..
	% make
Again, no need to install.

3. Build videoLat, by opening videoLat.xcodeproj and building it.
