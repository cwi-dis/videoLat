<h2>Getting Started</h2>

	<p>These are concise instructions, more complete help is available on
	the <a href="http://videoLat.org">videoLat.org website</a>.</p>

	<p>Before you can do real measurements you must obtain calibrations for
	your input and output devices. Try downloading calibrations from videolat.org
	first. If the calibrations you need are not available you must do them yourself.</p>

<h2>Roundtrip calibration</h2>

	<p>Select <em>New Calibration</em>, then <em>Video Roundtrip Calibration</em>.
	Select the camera you want to use. Use a mirror
	(or 2 mirrors) to make sure that camera gets a good view of the whole screen.
	Press <em>Continue</em>. You will see QR-codes and the <em>Count:</em> field
	will go from 10 to 0. When you see the blue screen you press <em>Run</em>.
	After enough measurements (a few hundred) press <em>Stop</em>. You will be
	shown the results of the measurement.</p>

<h2>Camera Calibration using Remote Calibrated Screen</h2>

	<p>For this you need a second device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) with videoLat for which
	you already have calibrations. Both devices should be on the same Wi-Fi network.</p>

	<p>On this device select <em>New Calibration</em>, then
	<em>Camera Calibration using Remote Calibrated Screen</em>.
	Select the camera you want to calibrate. Point it so that you can see the screen of
	the other device.</p>

	<p>On the other, calibrated, device select <em>New Measurement</em>, 
	then <em>Video Transmission (Master,Server)</em>. A QR-code will be shown on the
	master device and is picked up by the slave device, and it will connect to the master device
	over Wi-Fi, check the status indicators on the top of the slave device screen.</p>

	<p>On the master device press <em>Run</em>, and after a few hundred measurements
	<em>Stop</em>. You will be
	shown the results of the measurement, on both devices.</p>

<h2>Screen Calibration using Remote Calibrated Camera</h2>

	<p>For this you need a second device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) with videoLat for which
	you already have calibrations. Both devices should be on the same Wi-Fi network.</p>

	<p>On the other, calibrated, device select <em>New Measurement</em>, 
	then <em>Video Reception (slave,Client)</em>. Make sure the camera of this slave
	device can see the screen of the master device (the device you are calibrating).</p>

	<p>On the master device select <em>New Calibration</em>, then
	<em>Screen Calibrate using Remote Calibrated Camera (Master,Server)</em>.
	 A QR-code will be shown on the
	master device and is picked up by the slave device, and it will connect to the master device
	over Wi-Fi, check the status indicators on the top of the slave device screen.</p>

	<p>On the master device press <em>Run</em>, and after a few hundred measurements
	<em>Stop</em>. You will be
	shown the results of the measurement, on both devices.</p>
	
<h2>Roundtrip measurement</h2>

	<p>See the instruction video on the <a href="http://videoLat.org">videoLat.org website</a>
	for instructions on how to run a round-trip video delay measurement.</p>

<h2>One-way measurement</h2>

	<p>For a one-way measurement you need two devices with videoLat and the required
	calibrations. The master device must be on a network (Wi-Fi or Cellular) that is
	reachable by the slave device.</p>

	<p>On the slave device do <em>New Measurement</em>, 
	then <em>Video Reception (slave,Client)</em>. Make sure the camera of this slave
	device can see the screen of the system-under-test.</p>
	
	<p>On the master device do <em>New Measurement</em>, 
	then <em>Video Transmission (Master,Server)</em>. Make sure the screen of the master
	device is picked up by the camera of the system-under-test. 
	A QR-code will be shown on the
	master device and is picked up by the slave device, and it will connect to the master device
	over Wi-Fi, check the status indicators on the top of the slave device screen.</p>

	<p>On the master device press <em>Run</em>, and after a few hundred measurements
	<em>Stop</em>. You will be
	shown the results of the measurement, on both devices.</p>

<h2>Viewing measurements</h2>

	<p>Here you see the minimum, maximum and average of your measurement, plus
	information on where and how the measurement was done. You also see graphs
	with the individual measured delays and the distribution of those delays.</p>
	
	<p>Using the <em>Action</em> button you can print or email your measurement
	in various forms. You can also delete your measurement, and for calibrations
	you can upload them to videolat.org so other people can download it.</p>
