<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

	<p>VideoLat is a tool to help you analyse video delays, mainly aimed at
	conferencing applications. Basically, it works by generating a barcode
	on-screen and then measuring how long it takes until that same barcode
	is detected by the camera. This method of measurement also takes into
	account delays caused by camera, grabber hardware, video output card and
	the video display.</p>
	
	<p>VideoLat can take round-trip measurements, with the same system both
	benerating and detecting the barcodes. A future release will also allow
	asymetric measurements, using a videoLat-system on both ends. </p>
	
	<p>If you have access to the internals of the system-under-test it is
	possible to take measurements there as well, because videoLat encodes
	the current timestamp in the barcode. </p>
	
	<p>Because the camera of the system under test needs to see the videoLat
	screen and vice versa it may be best to get a separate USB camera
	attached to the videoLat system, using the builtin iSight may make it
	difficult to adjust things.</p>
	
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

	<p>Binary installers and source code can be downloaded via <a
	href="http://videolat.sourceforge.net">videolat.sourceforge.net</a>. The
	binary can be run in-place, no need to install it. To build from source,
	see the <i>README.txt</i> file included in the source distribution.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

	<p>If you want to use a USB camera, connect it before starting videoLat.
	Same for an external display.</p> <p>You probably want to disable screen
	dimming, in <i>System Preferences</i> -> <i>Energy Saver</i>.</p>
	
<h2 id="self-measurement">Self-measurement</h2>

	<p>To be able to interpret the numbers you should first measure the test
	harness, the computer running videoLat, itself. As you will want to
	subtract these measurements from your real measurements later, it is a
	good idea that you invest some time here to create a setup that gives
	you a normal (bell-curve) distribution of the delay times measured. This
	makes it easier to detect anomalies in the distribution of your real
	measurements. </p>
	
	<p>If you use a USB cam you simply point it at the screen, if you use
	the iSight you will have to use a mirror and set the <i>mirror view</i>
	flag. If you have a macBook it may be advisable to use an external
	screen: the timing of the builtin screen seems to be funny, giving a
	non-normal distribution. Connect camera and screen before running
	videoLat.</p>
	
	<p>If you want to change the output filename you must do so now, before
	starting the measurements. You also want to select the <i>Summarize</i>
	checkbox to compute mean, variance and delay distribution. Set
	<i>Role</i> to <i>Both</i>, check in the <i>Input</i> window that the
	camera has a reasonably undistorted view of the output window. Press
	<i>Run</i> to start the measurements. You should see the number of
	detected barcodes in the <i>Found:</i> field. If it remains at "<i>0 of
	nnnn</i>" things are not working.</p>
	
	<p>You want to take a lot of measurements, especially if your display
	frequency is close to your camera frequency. At around 500 the
	distribution seems to start looking like a normal distribution for me,
	but YMMV.</p>

<h2 id="output">Output Files</h2>

	<p>When you quit, the results are saved and postprocessed. If you have
	requested the <i>Summary</i> and you have iWork Numbers installed the
	results are opened automatically, otherwise you will find a file named
	<i>measurements-summary.csv</i> right beside your
	<i>Mmeasurements.csv</i> file. This file contains the
	count/min/max/mean/stddev of the measurements and their
	distribution.</p>
	
	<p>The raw output file consists of lines of the form:</p>
	
	<pre> timestamp,event,subevent,event-data,extra-info </pre>
	
	<p>For barcode generation and detection, event-data is the string
	encoded in the barcode, so you can match up generation and detection
	timestamps using this field. The extra-info may contain the measured
	overhead for creating and detecting the barcodes, this overhead should
	be subtracted from the delays.</p>

<h2 id="single-ended">Single-ended Measurement</h2>

	<p>The easiest real measurements to take are single-ended measurements,
	where a single test system running videoLat does both generation and
	reception. In this setup, you do not have to cater for system clock
	differences between sender and receiver. To use single-ended mesurements
	to measure delays over the net you setup the remote videoconferencing
	system so that its camera can see its own screen. If you need to use a
	mirror for this you set the <i>mirror view</i> checkbox.</p>
	
	<p>The real measurement follows the same pattern as for the
	self-measurement, it is assumed you understand how to point the
	respective cameras at the screens.</p>
	
	<p>Single-ended operation of a remote system will measure the round-trip
	delay, so you will need the divide the numbers by two, and this is
	assumying that your setup is symmetric (same hardware on both sides,
	symmetric network connection). </p>

<h2 id="asymmetric">Asymetric Measurement</h2>

	<p>Asymetric measurement is not practical yet in this release.</p>
